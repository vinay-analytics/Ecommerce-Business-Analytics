Turning data into decisions.

Project overview:-
<br>
This project focuses on analyzing real-world e-commerce data to uncover business insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, operational efficiency, and growth opportunities.

The goal is not just to analyze data, but to answer meaningful business questions and translate insights into actionable recommendations, similar to how a data analyst works in an industry setting.

BUSINESS PROBLEM:-
<br>
E-commerce companies deal with large volumes of data but often struggle to convert it into clear, decision-ready insights.

This project aims to help answer questions such as:

-How is revenue trending over time?
<br>
-Which products and customers drive the most value?
<br>
-Are delivery delays impacting customer satisfaction?
<br>
-Which regions or categories need attention?
<br>
-Where can the business improve operational efficiency?

DATASET:-
<br>
Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset (Olist)
The dataset contains ~100,000 real e-commerce orders with information on:

-Customers
<br>
-Orders
<br>
-Products
<br>
-Payments
<br>
-Sellers
<br>
-Reviews
<br>
-Delivery timelines

This multi-table structure closely resembles data used in real business environments.

TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES:-
<br>
-SQL – Data extraction, joins, aggregations, and trend analysis
<br>
-Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and insights
<br>
-Excel – Initial data exploration and validation
<br>
-Power BI – Interactive dashboards and KPI reporting
<br>
-GitHub – Version control and project documentation

KPIs ANALYZED:-
<br>
-Total Revenue
<br>
-Monthly Revenue Growth
<br>
-Average Order Value (AOV)
<br>
-Customer Retention Rate
<br>
-Delivery Time
<br>
-Customer Review Score

ANALYTICAL APPROACH:-
<br>
1.Business Understanding – Defined clear business questions and KPIs
<br>
2.Data Understanding – Studied table relationships and data quality
<br>
3.Data Extraction (SQL) – Built queries to extract meaningful metrics
<br>
4.Exploratory Data Analysis (Python) – Identified trends, patterns, and anomalies

<br>
-Repeat customers contribute significantly to overall revenue
<br>
-Delivery delays negatively impact customer review scores
<br>

<br>
(Insights will be expanded as the project progresses.)

PROJECT STATUS:-

FUTURE SCOPE:-
<br>
-Customer segmentation using machine learning
<br>
